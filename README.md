Project was Time Series Analysis, used ARIMA method to build the model. Major steps involved were as follow :

STEP: 1 - Data Cleaning and Analysis
STEP: 2 - Checking Stationarity (ADF Test)
STEP: 3 - Transformation
STEP: 4 - Differencing
STEP: 5 - Time Series Components
STEP: 6 - Finding ACF and PACF
STEP: 7 - ARIMA Modeling
STEP: 8 - Forecast
